# Leetcode-129.-Sum-Root-to-Leaf-Numbers
# 🔢 Sum of Root-to-Leaf Numbers 🌳

Transform paths in a binary tree into numbers and find their sum? Yes, please! 🙌  
This project provides an efficient recursive solution to calculate the **sum of all numbers** formed by root-to-leaf paths. Each path is treated like a number made from digits on the path — and the sum of all such numbers is returned. ✨

## 🚀 What It Does

It takes a binary tree 🌲 where each node contains a digit (0-9) and:
- Forms all possible numbers by reading values from **root to leaf** 🌿
- Calculates the **total sum** of these numbers 🔢

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity

| Operation               | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Root-to-leaf traversal | O(n)             | O(h)             |

- **n** = total number of nodes  
- **h** = height of the tree (due to recursion stack)
